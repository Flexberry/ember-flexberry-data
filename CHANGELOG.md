    - Properties `queueSyncDownWorksCount` and `completeSyncDownWorksCount` for tracking count of objects that should be synced down.
- `Adapter.Offline`:
    - Ability to specify table name for `clear` method. This case can be used for clearing one table.
    - Logic for saving parent models in offline mode (for create/update/delete operations). Now it is not using transactions (will be added in next versions).
- `Adapter.Odata`:
    - `timeout` property.
- `syncer` service:
    - Default error handlers. Override [`resolveServerError`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data/blob/5a4ae8a2ab6e8c85dff17a6908b25ead887b6f6d/addon/services/syncer.js#L222) and [`resolveNotFoundRecord`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data/blob/5a4ae8a2ab6e8c85dff17a6908b25ead887b6f6d/addon/services/syncer.js#L259) methods to add custom logic.
    - Saving changed relationships for sync up process.
    - Ability to specify query object in `syncDown` method in case of syncing down records by model type.
    - Ability to specify option for unloading records from online store when sync down. It's topical for sync down big data. Please add `{ unloadSyncedRecords: true }` as fourth parameter in `syncDown` method calls where needed.
    - `syncDownTime` property of model is setting now when performing sync down operation.
    - `allowSyncDownRelatedRecordsWithoutProjection` option for offline settings. If true then record will be synced down completely, i.e. including with all related records with arbitrary nesting. Otherwise only requested record will be synced down without related records.
- `Projection.Model`:
    - Validations for 'hasMany' relationships.
    - Model properties:
        - `isSyncingUp` - true if model is syncing up.
        - `isCreatedDuringSyncUp` - true if model is created during sync up process.
        - `isUpdatedDuringSyncUp` - true if model is updated last time during sync up process.
        - `isDestroyedDuringSyncUp` - true if model is destroyed during sync up process.
- Now `dexie` service can work with multiple DBs.
- Some parameters checks for `Query.Builder` and `Utils.Information` classes.


### Changed
- Update Dexie to 1.4.2 version.
- `Offline.Store`:
    - Now uses static `offlineSchema`. You must define `offlineSchema` property in `store` service of your application. **Important**. This changes are breaking!
- `syncer` service:
    - Changed arguments for `syncUp` method, first parameter now can be and array of jobs for execute, object with options for sync is second parameter now. **Important**. This changes are breaking!
    - Disable models unloads after sync down and sync up operations.
    - Now we don't replace entire record when sync down. Instead we save only changed properties which are specified in projection for existing records in local store.
- `Query.IndexedDBAdapter`:
    - Search by string (e.g. by all fields in lists) is now case insensitive.
- `Offline.LocalStore` and `Adapter.Offline`:
    - Renamed property `databaseName` to `dbName`.
- It is not necessary now to add attribute or relationship to model projection if it is needed for building restriction with query language.
- `Ember.Logger.xxx` changed to `Ember.xxx` calls and throwing errors. So redundant messages will not display in console in production.

### Fixed
- Loading relationships in offline mode moved "under" offline adapter layer, i.e. offline adapter now get "full object" at once with embedded objects for embedded relationships. So now fixed:
    - `Adapter.Offline` apply filters after loading relationships. This allows to filter data by master and detail model's proprties.
    - There is no relationships that "disappear" unexpectedly after reading data.
    - Improved performance for reading data in offline mode.
- `Adapter.Offline`:
    - Error at attempt to save existing records into IndexedDB.
    - Now it is able to save and read `null` value in `boolean` attributes in offline mode.
    - Not quite adequate implementation of `updateRecord` method.
    - Closing IndexedDB connection during CRUD operations.
    - Errors during parallel requests to IndexedDB (now using queue of requests).
    - Errors when making predicates for query object (when passed query to `query` method is not `QueryObject`).
    - Result type for `createRecord` and `updateRecord` methods.
- `Projection.StoreMixin`:
    - Wrong projection for reading data used in `findRecord` and `findAll` methods if projection was not specified for query.
- `Query.IndexedDBAdapter`:
    - IndexedDB not support filter by keys type of `boolean`.
    - Searching presence of relationships in query with `containsRelationships` method could return wrong results.
    - Sorting is now applying before skip and top.
- `Query.JsAdapter`:
    - Search by empty fields.
- Query language:
    - Querying records by fields of `date` type.
    - Filter by boolean value in offline mode, if restriction was passed through complex predicate.
- Optimizing performance:
    - For sync down operation.
    - Application loading performance.
    - For different operations with data in addon by setting some factories as singletons. It optimizes performance of lookup operation for particular factory because new instance of factory class is not creating.
    - CRUD operations in offline adapter.
- `syncer` service:
    - Unloading synced records from online store after sync down operation.
    - Relationships of model are not reset now when syncing up after changing model in offline mode.
    - Validation errors could break syncing up if model was updated in offline mode.
    - Wrong store instance was used for loading relationships in offline mode, it causes errors when syncing up.
    - Casting for `boolean` type and casting for `null` value of all types while performing sync up.
    - Saving of wrong relationship type for polymorphic belongsTo relationships in offline audit objects.
    - Some internal bugs in `syncDown` method.
    - Loading only one last relationship when restoring changes for record while performing sync up.
    - Considering types of attributes when restoring values while performing sync up, now it makes casting for `date` and `number` types.
    - `reloadLocalRecords` method tried to clear table using model class instead of model name.
- `Serializer.Offline`:
    - Now we are setting proper types of polymorphic belongsTo relationships in offline mode.
    - Serializing attributes of `boolean`, `number` and `decimal` types when saving offline.
    - `normalizeArrayResponse` method did not expect that adapter can return response in various format.
    - Processing of included objects in `normalizeArrayResponse` method.
- `Projection.Model`:
    - `rollbackBelongsTo` method.
    - Now `changedBelongsTo` is empty after saving created model.
- `Offline.ModelMixin`:
    - Audit fields was not filled because `save` method of `Offline.ModelMixin` run before `save` method of `Audit.ModelMixin`.
- `Offline.Store`:
    - Syncing down records with option `syncDownWhenOnlineEnabled` is now using specified projection for online store's method call.
    - `useOnlineStore` parameter is not deleting now from query object for `query` and `queryRecord` methods.
- `Offline.LocalStore`:
    - Projection passed in options now processing correctly in `findAll` and `findRecord` methods.
- Disable offline audit for `i-c-s-soft-s-t-o-r-m-n-e-t-security-agent` model.
- Remove validation from audit models.
